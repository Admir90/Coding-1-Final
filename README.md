# Coding-1-Final
Hello, welcome to my website. This website includes content about me, for example on the home page you are presented with a slideshow of pictures of my interests which is horses, track and field, and playing Fortnite. As you navigate to the nav bar each name will link you to a new page of the website. They will all be styled with CSS and have the same navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom. Also, on every page it has the same heading style, this is because they're are under the same div class. There is a large logo that once clicked it will also link you to the home page. In the contact me page you will find my contact information and on the about me page you will read a little bit about me.
